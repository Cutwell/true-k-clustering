# true-k-clustering
 Implementation of method described by Krista Rizman Žalik in [An efficient k′-means clustering algorithm](https://doi-org.plymouth.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2008.02.014)


### Notes
 - Example in `main.py` uses an approximate value of E, which has a 33% success rate. Further optimisation of the parameter is needed for a more consistent function.
 - Example in `naive.py` is for presentational purposes only. k' could be identified through algorithmic methods, but this is beyond the scope and so is not explored, requiring manual identification instead.
